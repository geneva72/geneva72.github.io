                            <p>
                                At the <a href="https://www.comsol.com/paper/predicting-fatigue-life-of-cold-sprayed-multi-materials-and-functionally-graded-materials-135902" target="_blank" style="color: #47a05b;">COMSOL Boston 2024 Conference</a>, I co-presented research on predicting the fatigue life of functionally graded materials (FGMs), a critical challenge for aerospace applications. This study used COMSOL Multiphysics to model stress accumulation and evaluate fatigue properties under operational conditions. The work aims to enhance the reliability and performance of FGMs, which offer unique benefits for thermal and structural engineering. By simulating damage mechanisms, the project provides valuable insights for designing materials capable of withstanding extreme environments.

                            <p>
                                My graduate research, supported by the <a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/asml/" target="_blank" style="color: #47a05b;">NASA Massachusetts Space Grant</a>, focused on understanding interfacial damage accumulation and its impact on heat generation in energetic materials. I designed mock explosive polymers using PDMS and sugar crystals to mimic real-world conditions safely. This innovative work identified mechanical and thermal stress points that could lead to volatile behavior, aiming to improve safety in manufacturing and handling processes. Through rigorous testing and modeling, the project contributes to safer standards for industrial explosive materials.

                            <p>
                                During my undergraduate capstone project, I developed a microfluidics platform designed for analyzing molecular dispersion through Taylor Dispersion techniques. This accessible and low-cost system allows researchers to study fluid dynamics with high precision, opening new possibilities for applications in chemistry, biology, and engineering. Working in a cutting-edge lab, I utilized fluorescein dye experiments to validate the system’s performance, producing results that demonstrate its versatility for various fields.

                                In an interdisciplinary project aimed at simplifying physics concepts, I created a series of multimedia educational videos designed to make science engaging and accessible. I was responsible for writing, directing, and narrating content that covered topics such as energy conservation and wave dynamics. Each video was tailored to present complex ideas through visually appealing and relatable storytelling, helping to inspire a broader audience.
